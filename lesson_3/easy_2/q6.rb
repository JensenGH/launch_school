# How can we add the family pet "Dino" to our usual array:

flintstones = %w(Fred Barney Wilma Betty BamBam Pebbles)
flinstones.push("Dino") # Push method which pushes the given object to the end of array.
flinstones << "Dino" # Shovel operator that appends given object to end of array.

# Both of these methods are destructive which mutate the original object.
