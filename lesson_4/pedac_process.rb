## P: Understanding the problem

Establish the rules/ define the boundaries of the problem
  - Assess available information
  - Restate Explicit requirements
  - Identify Implicit requirements
Spend enough time. Don't rush this step

** General Example:

Problem:
Given a string, produce a new string with every other word removed.

Explicit requirements:
Input: String
Output: String (new)
Remove every other word from input string

Questions:
What do we mean by every other word?
How do we define a word in this context?
  - Words are delimited by spaces

## E: Examples/ Test Cases

- Can confirm/ refute assumptions
- Help to answer questions about implicit requirements
- Act as assertions which help to codify the rules and boundaries

## D: Data Structures

- Help reason with data logically
- Help interact with data at an implemenation level
- Thinking in terms of data structures is part of the problem solving process
- Data structures closely linked to algorithm
  - Set of steps from input to output
    - Involves structuring data in a certain way

## A: Algorithm

- A logical sequence of steps for accomplishing a task or objective
  - Closely linked to data structures
  - Series of steps to structure data to produce the required output
- Stay abstract/ high level
  - Avoid implementation detail
  - Don't worry about efficiency for now

## C: Implement a solution in code

- Translating solution algorithm to code
- Think about algorithm in context of programming language
  - Language features and constraints
  - Characteristics and data structures
  - Built in functions/ methods
  - Syntax and coding patterns
- Create test cases
- Code with intent (think about what each line of code is doing and why)
